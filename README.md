# Blade for WordPress

WP Blade brings the beloved Blade template engine to your WordPress-theme.

Blade is a much simpler template language than vanilla PHP, and compiles down to readable PHP.

The plugin is intended for WordPress theme-developers that want to write a different flavor of template languages.

Read more about Blade in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/blade).

For documentation and tips on how to get started using Blade in WordPress, please [check the docs](http://blade.tormorten.no/).

## Changes

For the 2.0 release the vendor for Blade has been changed, making WP Blade have less dependencies, and require a lower PHP version (5.4).

### Notice before upgrading from WP Blade

WP Blade 2 contains breaking changes (a new initalization method). Please read the docs before upgrading.
